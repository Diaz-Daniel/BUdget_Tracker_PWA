# Budget_Tracker

## Goal of the Project

Add functionality to the existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Project Requirements

- When I am taken offline I am still able to enter deposits and expenses offline;

- When I am brought back online all entries are added to the tracker;
